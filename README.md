# Google-Reverse-Image-Search-Unity
###What's new?
Well, times passed and i finally got to github, so now i can complete some people's request to publish my solution on parsing google's best guess html code without the help of the external server.
Also there are two significant editions that i made:
- I completely re-wrote the original code in order to structurize it and make it more readable.
- Description: if no info was gotten from the wikipedia the app tries to get some from the Oxford Dictionary API.
